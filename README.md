# IstioCon  Recap

## IstioCon has passed two weeks and now all recording are available to watch. It is also a good time for a recap: 

The first time IstioCon has attracted more than  <b> 4000 </b> registrations from about <b> 80 </b>  countries!  Really a great milestone for the Istio community!

## Some of my minor thoughts for IstioCon are as below: 

 * We can see Istio has been widely used in production.  Multiple talks were sharing experience for Isito in production like eBay, saleforce, T-Mobile etc. Edge is also a potential area for Istio.

 * Istio has been very innovative in 2020 and many new features have been released. Istio will focus on day-2 operation in 2021 to keep the architecture stable and reduce operational overhead in debugging, maintainance, upgrade, etc. 

 * Istio is still a bit complex so many companies are providing their own encapsulation layer to erase burden for their end users.  The other trend is Istio will make itself align with kubernetes API as its best effort. 

 * Lack of hardware acceleration topic in IstioCon. 

## <b>Intel</b> did great contributions for this event and is one of the Sponsors for the event. We also have three sessions accepted as persentation talks as below:
